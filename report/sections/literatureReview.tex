\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:literatureReview}

\section{Textbook}
The textbook \cite{manning2008introduction} introduces the classification problem. That is, given a set of classes, the goal is to determine what subset of those classes a document may belong to. To that end, the textbook describes a number of methodologies for selecting features. These features are then used by one of the classification methods discussed. The primary methods discussed are Na\"{i}ve Bayes, Vector Space Classification, and the Support Vector Machine.

As we progress with our reading and understanding of the material, this section will be updated to reflect that.

\section{Papers}
Currently the only paper that has been used as a reference is the final report of the classification team from last year \cite{cui2015classification}. We have read through this report to understand the progress that the Classification team made last year as well as using the paper to gain an understanding of the task and interactions of the systems that we are working with. The biggest difference from last year's work to this year's work is that we will be primarily using Apache Spark, and so while we will be able to reference their work, we are using entirely different technologies.

As more papers are found and reviewed, appropriate summaries will be added to this section.
